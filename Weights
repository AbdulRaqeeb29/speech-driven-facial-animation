References to the weights of the model are given below.
I hereby attach the link to google drive where you will the find three folders numpy_data in which the data 
is preprocessed and trained, original_data in which there is a image and audio inputs taken for training the model, 
and the weights of the model which has both the generator and discriminator weights.
